        <b>FC Barcelona</b> is a football club founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German and English players led by Joan Gamper. The club plays in the first division of Spain, known as La Liga, since its creation in 1928 and has never been relegated. The club has the blue and red colors on its shirt, which were inspired by the rugby team of Merchant Taylors’ Boys’ School, where two English brothers who participated in the beginnings of Barça studied.
